### Calculate the volume of a revolved solid in illustrator

I programmed this javascript to calculate the volume of a revolved solid from a contour. Letting you design bottles or other cylindrical / revolved containers easily inside adobe illustrator. Draw one side of the contour; execute the script and; voila! See how much the revolved solid based on the contour contains in centilitres. Easy instructions and example files included.
